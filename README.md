# ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project will be using various AI and Rule Engine algorithm to detect various attack against a website!

# ðŸ“Œ Mission
After starting my infosec journey,I understood that majority of vulnerability can be easily mitigated in source code while building the app itself, This Project will be employ APIs which work on runtime to detect and block threat actors

# ðŸ”§ Tech Stack used
1. ReactJS
2. Django
3. MySQL
4. Tensorflow 

# Our Team
Our project consist of three teams
1. Frontend Developer
2. Machine learning 
3. Security Engineers and Security Researchers


# Frontend Team
Frontend Team will be building Frontend components of this project such as Dashboard, Analytics page etc


# ML Team
Machine learning team will be building ML algorithms based on various datasets to detect those threats (Primarily we will be using Classifier)

# Security Engineer Team

Security Engineer will be researching on various publicly known web security threats and collecting payloads to build a massive dataset for ML team
